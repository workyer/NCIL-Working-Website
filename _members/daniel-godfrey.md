I am a Master’s student in the Psychology & Neuroscience program. My research focuses on brain-computer interface (BCI) technology. BCIs are electronic systems that allow people to operate software or hardware devices using brain activity as input, rather than traditional tools that require muscular control (e.g., mouse, keyboard, joystick). 
    My research team is currently exploring various stimulus manipulations, electrical brain responses, and machine learning algorithms to determine the optimal combination for fast, accurate BCI performance. Our work offers ample volunteer, research assistant, and independent study opportunities. If you have insatiable curiosity and a keen interest in neuroscience, computer science, and/or data science, feel free to inquire about getting involved. NCIL BCI, OMG!
